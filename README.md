Here you can see a webpage with the addition of a catalog of a movie theater goodies company. 
The project did not make it to production, because at the last moment the customer changed his mind and changed the terms of reference to a business card site with a logo and phone number :(

Here are only templates developed with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/jQuery.
I was planning to implement a CMS, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
